      <p>In need of a pet sitter for our beloved animals. We have a trip planned in the near future and although we would love to bring them along, we cannot. In the household we have 2 dogs (Chance and Aria), 2 cats (Raven and Boots), and 8 fish. We need someone that can take care of them while we are away. Very low maintance and a relaxing get away for any pet lover.

        <h4>Daily Routine</h4>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin: 20px 0">Chance and Aria are not morning dogs. They lounge around for most of the morning and are content to sit in the back yard looking at the birds and lizards passing by. A short walk is a sure way to get them up and moving. </li>
        <li style="margin: 20px 0">After their morning stroll, they enjoy playing with their favorite toys and sunbathing by the window. </li>
        <li style="margin: 20px 0">They share their food and water bowls and munch on it through out the day. This is something to keep track of and fill as needed. They usually only eat one bowl of food a day.</li>
        <li style="margin: 20px 0"> They enjoy going outside often, but at least 3 times a day. They are house trained but when they got to go, they got to go!</li>
        <p class="alert alert-danger fade in"><strong>Beware: </strong> Aria will start digging holes if left alone outside for too long. Check her paws before she comes inside or you might find dirty paw prints all over the house.</p>

        <h4>Daily Routine</h4>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0">They love treats and they love to play. It might take them a while to warm up to a new person but they will come running for wet food. Just open up a can and give each of them half. </li>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0">Without food to keep them occupied, they can both get pretty vocal. They both love to play with their favorite string toy and that is something they never get tired of.</li>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0">The cats share their water bowl with the dogs so it is important to keep this refilled. The cats also have their own food bowls on top of a table so that the dogs can't reach it. </li>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0">You'll want to make sure that the door to the master closet is left open so that they are able to get to their litter boxes.</li>
            <li style="margin: 20px 0">They are not outdoor cats, so they won't try to leave unless a door is left open long enough. Make sure to leave the front and sliding glass doors closed.</li>
