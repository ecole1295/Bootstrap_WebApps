      <p>In need of a pet sitter for our beloved animals. We have a trip planned in the near future and although we would love to bring them along, we cannot. In the household we have 2 dogs (Chance and Aria), 2 cats (Raven and Boots), and fish. We need someone that can take care of them while we are away. Very low maintance and a relaxing get away for any pet lover.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Chance & Aria</h3>
        <h4>Daily Routine</h4>
    <p>The dogs can eat at their own pace, just leave a constant amount of food and water available. Make sure the dogs are able to get outside to use the bathroom and to stretch their legs from time to time. They are house trained but when they got to go, they got to go!</p>
    <p>Aria likes to dig if she thinks she isn't being watched. If you see it happening stop her but you dont need to be constantly watching them while outside, just make sure to check paws before coming back into the house. Both of them can get a little emotional if we aren't home and this is orchestrated by Chance. Tell them to stop and they will settle down just as fast as it starts. Aria also knows when she did something wrong, she is the master of playing "Im sorry" by rolling on her back and becoming defenseless</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Raven & Boots</h3>
        <h4>Daily Routine</h4>
        <p>The cats eat at their own pace, just keep food bowls full. Keep the desk space clear by the fish tank so that they can get to their food. If the cat food is on the ground the dogs will eat it. The cats litter box is in the master closet, make sure the door does not close. They are also not outdoor cats, they wont try to get out but dont leave any exterior doors open.</p>
        <p>Raven is the all black cat. She keeps to herself and sleeps by the living room window for the most part but will one of the first to come lay ith you if she decides she likes you. Boots is the skinny cat with white paws. She's the sasse cat in the house. She'll love you right off the bat and she'll want to rub up against you whenever she feels. She's the active one and you may hear her playing at night and "singing the songs of her people" in the middle of the night.</p>

        <h4>Daily Routine</h4>
        <p>The fish are easy to please. Feed the fish a pinch of food every morning and turn on the tank light. Boots will be there to watch the fish eat and attempt yoAt night, turn the light off. If for any reason you cannot turn off the light for that day, leave it off the whole day.</p>
        <p>In the case that a fish dies, there is a tiny green net by the tank. just use it to get the fish out and flush him down the toilet. We dont expect any other maintence of the tank.</p>
